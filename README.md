This is No.1 on my Web Development List as I learn Ruby on Rails. My idea is to make 12 basic implementations of popular web applications on the web. As i progress I'll upload the apps onto Github and possibly run them on Heroku. Hopefully by the time I'm finished with 12 my skills would have improved.
